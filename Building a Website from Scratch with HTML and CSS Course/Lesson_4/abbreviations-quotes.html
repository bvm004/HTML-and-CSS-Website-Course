    <p>Martin Luther King Jr. once said <q>I have a dream</q>.</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://www.npr.org/2010/01/18/122701268/i-have-a-dream-speech-in-its-entirety">
      <p>And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet,
        from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, Black men and
        white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of
        the old Negro spiritual:
        Free at last. Free at last. Thank God almighty, we are free at last.</p>
